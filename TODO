systemd.cil: 
    files_relabel_non_auth_except() is too coarse, and is a temporary solution

    hopefully this can be trimmed to for example files_relabel_all_run_files(), or less

    systemd needs to at least be able to relabel the sock files of socket activated subjects
    there is probably more but the current solution can hopefully be improved

    update:
        it is not as easy as i thought it would be
        systemd relabels almost all over the place

various:
    systemd uses tmpfs a lot but does not fix labels right after it mounts, or is not able to
    this causes content to at least temporarily end up with inappropriate contexts

    examples: /run/mount/mtab, /run/tmpfiles.d/kmod.conf, run/user/$UID

    currently access to tmpfs_t is allowed where this is required
    this needs to be monitored over time and be corrected when possible

    /run/initramfs may be an exception to that rule

shutdownd.cil
    files_list_all() is too coarse, and needs to be trimmed

    this macro call fixes an unclean shutdown though
    grep -i recover /var/log/boot.log shows that fsck recovers /root without this rule

miscfiles.cil:
    create a miscfiles_read_terminfo_files()

    clients read those in both /etc/terminfo as well as /usr/share/terminfo
    if we label those with a private type than we can drop the files_read_generic_etc_files(), as
    well as files_read_generic_usr_files() calls

session.cil:
    some of the (typetransition) rules in the role_template() calls can (and should) probably
    be moved to the source template macro itself

    on second thought, maybe not (probably not)

    added: still worth investigating though

auth.cil:
    miscfiles_read_generic_cert_files() and miscfiles_read_network_config_files()
    should probably be associated with is_nsswitch_client_subject

    (probably also devices_read_urandom())

    this is fixed: self create_unix_stream_socket_perms should also be associated with
    is_auth_nsswitch_client_subject (fixed at the root by allowing anyone that unix stream socket
    connectto, to "self create_unix_stream_socket_perms" If is_dns_resolve_client_subject needs
    "self create_unix_stream_socket_perms" to unix stream connectto avahi, then avahi_stream_connect()
    should provide this access

    miscfiles_read_network_config_files() would probably be associated with
    is_dns_resolve_client_subject which in turn is associated with is_auth_nsswitch_client_subject

pulseaudio:
    review what callers of pa_client_subject need and have in common

    Example: there may be rules in moc.cil that apply to all callers of
    pa_client_subject() instead of just is_moc_subject

    I suppose one could compare the moc rules to rules of other pa_client_subject() callers 

systemd-coredump:
    this utility is executed by a kernel worker thread (system_t)

tmpfiles.cil:
    implement a tmpfiles_config_object(), and apply that to targeted subjects where possible
    this is for administration purposes

systemd.cil: 
    files_relabel_non_auth_except() is too coarse, and is a temporary solution

    hopefully this can be trimmed to for example files_relabel_all_run_files(), or less

    systemd needs to at least be able to relabel the sock files of socket activated subjects
    there is probably more but the current solution can hopefully be improved

    update:
        it is not as easy as i thought it would be
        systemd relabels almost all over the place

various:
    systemd uses tmpfs a lot but does not fix labels right after it mounts, or is not able to
    this causes content to at least temporarily end up with inappropriate contexts

    examples: /run/mount/mtab, /run/tmpfiles.d/kmod.conf, run/user/$UID

    currently access to tmpfs_t is allowed where this is required
    this needs to be monitored over time and be corrected when possible

    /run/initramfs may be an exception to that rule

shutdownd.cil
    files_list_all() is too coarse, and needs to be trimmed

    this macro call fixes an unclean shutdown though
    grep -i recover /var/log/boot.log shows that fsck recovers /root without this rule

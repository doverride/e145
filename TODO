target (gnome doing access checks):
    epiphany nautilus evolution
    label /usr/bin/firefox for gnome access check
    /usr/bin/bluetooth-sendto

target ssmtp (cron wants it)

pulseaudio client subjects: review them, there may be duplicate rules

session: re-evaluate dbus_system_client_subject(session_t) (packagekit plugin i think)
    and capability sys_admin

atspi: deal with accessibility technology more gracefully
    various components listen and accept unix stream socket connections
    on atspi sockets in ~

xdg: anyone how maintains anything in .config/.local/.cache needs to also
    be able to maintain those dirs properly

remove hacks to deal with mislabeled /run/user:
    grep -ri run_user_hack .

target: logrotate, cron system jobs

target /usr/sbin/glibc_post_upgrade.*
    i suspect this is what makes select exec fles end up with file_t type
    by confining it i mabe be able to make it create those files with
    the proper context

    rpm: for some reason files get installed labeled with type file_t
        Update: role transition does not fix this issue

setbool: make setbool security av permission conditional for callers
    of unconfined_subject() because else they can go around the other
    conditionals (ptrace, execmem etc)

orc: orc patches to make orc more selinux friendly were removed
    currently i am forced to allow callers of liborc to manage and mmap
    generic run content files

    if the selinux friendly functionality gets upstreamed i should remove
    the policy that allows libord callers to manage/mmap generic run user content
    (currently pa is the only liborc caller that is covered in my policy)

net_admin
    requests for this capability need to be reviewed system-wide

/usr/lib/.*\.d(/.*)?
    and their respective counterparts in /etc if applicable

    create private types for the various .d dirs in there
    binfmt.d, modprobe.d, modules-load.d, sysctl.d, sysusers.d, tmpfiles.d

block_suspend review block_suspend use
    these is a bug in kernel which triggers false block suspend
    a patch to fix that has been submitted, and once this bug is fixed, remove
    all block suspend calls to see who really needs it 

useradd:
    due to not using libsemanage/genhomedircon, useradd requires a user manual for
    this implementation

    if you add a new user, you should make sure that file context specifications
    for that users home dir exist (explicit entries)

    if you don't then useradd will fail with "cannot get selinux context for /home/joe"
    (or something similar)

systemd: emergency service
    the kids changed emergency.service in rawhide to run sulogin and systemctl
    from a shell

    i copied /usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service to /etc/systemd/system/
    and modified it to reflect upstream (upstream does it right)

grubby/bootloader: deal with /boot/grub2/grub (.cfg) on non-efi systems
    kernel upgrade fails on non efi systems

systemd: i added file transition rules for dirs that are not created but are
    instead installed by tmpfiles (see /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf)
    remove those file type transition rules as they are redundant

    update: if and when i do this then i must take time to actually
    make sure that these locations arent created by these processes
    e.g. delete the dir, then reproduce an event that requires the location
    and see if something creates the location or fails

investigate support debug-shell / systemd-debug-generator

autorelabel: find a way to deal with fedora-autorelabel-mark.service

systemd:
    on early boot systemd/tmpfiles.d create select object in /run with the wrong label

    /usr/lib/systemd/dbus.socket

    /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/initscripts.conf
    /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/pam.conf
    /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/screen.conf

    the workaround is to copy these to /etc/systemd/system, and /etc/tmpfiles.d
    respecitively and then s/'/var/run'/run there

session:
    review whether session actually runs busproxyd, and askpwd directly

    i am pretty sure that session runs askpwdagent directly, however i wonder whether
    askpwdagent runs askpwd and/or busproxyd instead of session directly

    for now i allowed session to run askpwd, and busproxyd directly with a domain transition

    the fact that for example bus-proxyd is installed in /usr/lib/systemd makes me think
    that this command is not intended to be run directly from a user shell session

various:
    clean up modules like seutil, nettools and other by grouping policy using "is_subject" attributes

    many of these individual types have permissions in common.
    group them to increase readability and efficiency

auth.cil:
    miscfiles_read_generic_cert_files() and miscfiles_read_network_config_files()
    should probably be associated with is_nsswitch_client_subject

    (probably also devices_read_urandom())

    miscfiles_read_network_config_files() would probably be associated with
    is_dns_resolve_client_subject which in turn is associated with is_auth_nsswitch_client_subject

various:
    systemd uses tmpfs a lot but does not fix labels right after it mounts, or is not able to
    this causes content to at least temporarily end up with inappropriate contexts

    examples: /run/mount/mtab, /run/tmpfiles.d/kmod.conf, run/user/$UID

    currently access to tmpfs_t is allowed where this is required
    this needs to be monitored over time and be corrected when possible

    /run/initramfs may be an exception to that rule

shutdownd.cil
    files_list_all() is too coarse, and needs to be trimmed

    this macro call fixes an unclean shutdown though
    grep -i recover /var/log/boot.log shows that fsck recovers /root without this rule
